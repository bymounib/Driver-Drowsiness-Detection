## Abstract:

This is my end-of-year project : Driver Drowsiness Detection which is an automotive technology that helps prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. Thanks to computer vision and deep learning algorithms we can develop a model to control the driver's eyes through a stream of images with a camera linked to a Raspberry Pi card, to detect whether a person is sleeping or not and make him alert if he is drowsy.
Finally, this study deals with the intelligent cars that aims to decrease the number of accidents related to fatigue and drowsiness.
